# Dynamic Social Network Analysis Course at LVIV-DSSS-2018 

This is the material for the course about machine learning for dynamic
social network analysis held at the Lviv Data Science Summer School 2018.

## Requirements

  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Hawkes

Here, we model recurring user activities with the help of Hawkes Processes.

You will need to implement one function (`sampleHawkes`) in the file
`simPointProcess.py`. The file may be run in an interactive console and is self
explanatory.

## Redqueen

Here, we perform smart broadcasting with the help of stochastic optimal
control.

You will need to implement several functions in the file `opt_model.py`. The
README file inside the `redqueen` subfolder contains additional information.
